Hello! 

My name is Trey Whitehead, and I am a rising senior at Harvard University studying Applied Mathematics. 
I am a ROTC cadet, and upon graduation, I will commission as an Operations Research Analyst into the United States Air Force. 

In this repository, I have included a few projects from my time in college. Python is my language of choice, but I have experience in Mathematica, C, MATLAB, SQL, JavaScript, AMPL, Mathematica, and a few others.  

If you would like to see examples of my coursework, please email me at treywhitehead@college.harvard.edu for access to my private repository.
